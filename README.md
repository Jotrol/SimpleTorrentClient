# SimpleTorrentClient

There's a naive implementation of BitTorrent Protocol.
There are a lot of errors, but I was able to download couple of films and watch them.
I know, that there is an error that client didn't download files fully, but this is films (I aimed for them), let's be honest, nobody ever watched any film till the end)
Also, there is no optimization at all. I repeat, it's very naive implementation, all functionality wrapped over functions. Needless to say, it's not using any kind of 3rd party libraries, except ones that came with Python.
Possible using in learning, for now it's not ready to truly usage.
